#### SFTP connection
The [ssh package](https://pub.dev/packages/ssh) is used to connect to SFTP, which wraps iOS library [NMSSH](https://github.com/NMSSH/NMSSH) and Android library [JSch](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/).

#### Connection data
The connections are saved in two JSON files (favorites.json & recentlyAdded.json).<br/>
On Android the files are located in the ApplicationDocumentsDirectory.<br/>
On iOS the files are located in the ApplicationSupportDirectory.

#### Downloaded files
On Android the downloaded files are saved to external storage (default: /storage/emulated/0/RemoteFiles). The location can be changed on Android in the settings.<br/>
On iOS the downloaded files are saved in the ApplicationDocumentsDirectory.

#### Get directories
The [path_provider package](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) is used to get the directories listed above.

#### Permissions
To save files to external storage, the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission is needed on Android. To request and check this permission the [permission_handler package](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) is used.
